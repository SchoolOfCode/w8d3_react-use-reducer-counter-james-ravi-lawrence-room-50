# useReducer Workshop

## Task: Refactor A Counter With useReducer

- Navigate to src/components/Counter.
- Use the links to the documentation below to refactor the `Counter` component so that it uses `useReducer` instead of `useState`:
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer
  - https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer

## Bonus: Test Your Reducer

- Test your reducer function using Jest.

**NOTE: Jest is already installed as part of Create-React-App. Don't manually `npm i jest`, or it will break!**
